They had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Second only to The Beach Boys in Billboard singles and albums chart success among American bands, Chicago is one of the longest-running and most successful rock groups in history."

They are considered a very-early heavy metal band as a result of this song and others like it as well as the title of their debut album, 'Heavy'. Their heyday was the late-60s, but the band has been reincarnated several times with various members. Also known for being the first RIAA certified platinum group, VH1 ranks them as number 19 on their list of top 100 \"one hit wonders\"."
