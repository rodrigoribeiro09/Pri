            "American pride something you feel inside  \r\nSomething you can't describe American pride  \r\nDad said, \"Son I'm proud you won  \r\nBut the game is more than any toy\"  \r\nMama said, \"Now Son say sir and say ma'am  \r\nAnd be proud you're southern born\"  \r\nYou play when you're hurt and you work when you're tired  \r\n'Cause that was Grandpa's way  \r\nAnd the biscuits are better at Granny's house  \r\nAnd the gravy taste great all day  \r\nAmerican pride yes it is something you feel inside  \r\nSomething you can't describe, something you cannot hide  \r\nAmerican pride something you feel inside  \r\nTraditions run deep and wide with American pride  \r\nWhen a baby is born we all celebrate  \r\nWith tears of joy in family eyes  \r\n'Cause we all know the baby will grow up with American pride  \r\nYeah we work and we play and we have our own ways  \r\nAnd we don't all look alike  \r\nBut if the cause is right we stand up and fight  \r\nTo protect our American pride  \r\nSing it, sing it, sing it  \r\nAmerican pride yes it is something you feel inside  \r\nIt's something you can't describe, it's something you can't hide  \r\nAmerican pride something you feel inside  \r\nTraditions run deep and wide with American pride  \r\nWith American pride, it's American pride\r\n\r\n"
