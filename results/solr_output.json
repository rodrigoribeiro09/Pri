The band is particularly associated with the New Romantic scene, although it both pre- and post-dated the peak of that movement by several years. Known for popular hits such as \"Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\" and \"Vienna\" among many others, the band has drawn inspiration variously from dark, moody post-punk, the artier side of glam rock, and latterly straightforward synthpop."

Monde\"  \nMonsieur are. Monde you are not  \nThat's an incredible thing to say  \nWhy I personally attended his funeral  \nWhich was twelve months to this very day  \nA rat flew down from the ceiling  \nAlighted upon my right ear  \nSaid if Monsieur are. Monde is safe under the sod  \nThen why are you shaking with fear  \nMy name is not Scrooge I said faintly  \nAnd from ghosts I have nothing to fear  \nBut if you are are. Monde returned from the dead  \nThen what are you wanting here  \nFrom nowhere I heard a mad cackle  \nFrom nowhere a voice to me cried  \n\"Stop calling me Monsieur are.

The band's claim to fame is 'A Whiter Shade of Pale', a huge hit in 1967. The band differed from most of the progressive rock bands of the 70s in the relatively prominent blues component to their sound, largely due to the voice and piano of leader Gary Brooker. In the early years, Matthew Fisher's organ and Robin Trower's guitar combined for a unique sound."
