(Oops!)  \r\nYou're like a rush, you're like a drug, it's just the sight of you  \r\nI like to think that I could kick you but it's what you do  \r\nYou knew we could be  \r\nWhat's the lord think of me  \r\nFor being so fucking weak I find it hard for me to breathe  \r\n  \r\nSo here's where my story ends  \r\nI got to make amends  \r\nI let me down  \r\nAgain and again and again and again  \r\n  \r\nAll I wanted from you  \r\nWas a night, maybe two  \r\nYou beat me at my own game  \r\nNo it's not okay  \r\nI'm the one that's missing out  \r\nAll I needed to do  \r\nWas get just a taste of you  \r\nAnd now I'm sick all in my head  \r\nYou poisoned me instead  \r\nTrust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down  \r\n  \r\nHere's what we have to do  \r\nStay together and keep it true  \r\nCan't be strong, too late for cool  \r\nI won't live without you  \r\nYou are not rid of me  \r\n  \r\nAll I wanted from you  \r\nWas a night, maybe two  \r\nYou beat me at my own game  \r\nNo it's not okay  \r\nI'm the one that's missing out  \r\nAll I needed to do  \r\nWas get just a taste of you  \r\nAnd now I'm sick all in my head  \r\nYou poisoned me instead  \r\nTrust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down\r\n\r\n",
