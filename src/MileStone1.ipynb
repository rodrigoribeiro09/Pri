    "# Milestone #1: Data Preparation\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Music information is an important area in modern information systems, with applications ranging from recommendation engines to lyric-based search platforms. In this project, we present Tunix, a text-based search system inspired by Shazam, but designed to work without audio input. Instead, Tunix allows users to search for songs by typing lyrics, retrieving corresponding tracks, artists, and descriptive metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final system aims to provide efficient lyric-based search functionality, offering accurate results along with artist descriptions and related attributes, thereby improving music discovery through text queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Music retrieval systems such as Shazam have transformed how users interact with music, but they are primarily based on audio fingerprinting. In many cases, users may remember a fragment of lyrics rather than the melody. This project addresses this gap by creating Tunix, a system that retrieves songs, artists, and related information based on text queries derived from lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tunix will integrate datasets containing tracks, artists, lyrics, and metadata into a unified and searchable database. The system is designed to return not only the matching track but also relevant contextual information such as artist biography and related metadata. This project contributes to the field of Information Retrieval by developing a structured pipeline for music data collection and preparation, enabling efficient and accurate text-based search functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data search:\n",
    "- During our search for a suitable music dataset, we found many databases on this topic. However, most of them lacked song lyrics, while others included numerous attributes such as danceability and liveness, which were not relevant to our main objective. The biggest challenge we faced was related to artist information, as it was difficult to find datasets containing proper artist descriptions. To address this issue, we discovered that several APIs provide detailed information: given the name of a song, it is possible to retrieve the artist’s name, description, and additional attributes related to the song, the artist, and even the album.\n",

    "## Select convenient data subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Despite the availability of several good databases, we chose the Spotify Million Song Dataset. Although it contains fewer features, it is rich in music records and has fewer distinct artists, which reduces the number of required API calls. This way, we obtain fewer artists but more songs per artist. We also assumed that any additional attributes could later be retrieved through APIs to complement the dataset with artist information. \n",
    "- For this purpose, we selected the Genius API, as it focuses specifically on artists and music, providing detailed descriptions and additional metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assess the authority of the data source and data quality\n",
    "- Dataset: Spotify Million Song Dataset – Kaggle:\n",
    "    - Authority: Public dataset on Kaggle, licensed CC0 (free to use). It’s a subset of the original Million Song Dataset.\n",
    "    - Data Quality: Contains song names, artist names, lyrics, and links. Some entries may be missing or duplicate. \n",
    "- Genius API:\n",
    "    - Authority: Genius is a well-known platform for song lyrics and artist info. The API is official, documented, and widely used.\n",
    "    - Data Quality: Provides structured, regularly updated data. Some songs or artists may be missing, and user-contributed info can vary in quality.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Main Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to **enrich our dataset** with additional metadata obtained via the **Last.fm API**.  \n",
    "Specifically, we aim to collect the following fields:\n",
    "- **Primary Artist Description**\n",
    "- **Album Title**\n",
    "- **Release Date**\n",
    "- **Track Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Achieve This\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Root:**  \n",
    "`http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/`  \n",
    "\n",
    "All requests use the following base parameters:  \n",
    "- `method` — specifies the API method to call  \n",
    "- `api_key` — your Last.fm API key  \n",
    "- `format=json` — to receive results in JSON format  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Normalize Input Row\n",
    "Prepares clean `(song, artist)` pairs for each dataset row.  \n",
    "- The helper function picks the first non-empty value for both song and artist.  \n",
    "- Ensures consistent capitalization and trimming.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Track Search — `search_track(track, artist)`\n",
    "Finds the best track match and retrieves its identifiers.  \n",
    "- **Method:** `track.search`  \n",
    "- **Returns:** `(track_mbid, artist_mbid, track_name, artist_name)`  \n",
    "- **Endpoint example:**  \n",
    "  ```\n",

    "  ---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Artist Metadata — `get_artist_info(artist_name, artist_mbid)`\n",
    "Retrieves descriptive information about the artist.  \n",
    "- **Method:** `artist.getInfo` (prefer MBID; fallback to name)  \n",
    "- **Extracted fields:**\n",
    "- `bio.content` or `bio.summary` → cleaned HTML text (via `_clean_html`)\n",
    "- `name` → normalized artist name  \n",
    "- **Special handling:**  \n",
    "- Detect and retry in case of “incorrect tag” boilerplate responses.  \n",

    "#### 4. Track Metadata — `get_track_info(track_name, artist_name, track_mbid)`\n",
    "Fetches detailed information about the track and its album.  \n",
    "- **Method:** `track.getInfo` (prefer MBID when available)  \n",
    "- **Extracted fields:**\n",
    "- `track.wiki.content` or `track.wiki.summary` → cleaned track description  \n",
    "- `track.wiki.published` → track-level release date (if available)  \n",
    "- `track.album` → `album.title` and `album.mbid` (if present)  \n",
    "- **Endpoint example:** \n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=track.getInfo\n",
