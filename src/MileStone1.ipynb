    "# Milestone #1: Data Preparation\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Music information is an important area in modern information systems, with applications ranging from recommendation engines to lyric-based search platforms. In this project, we present Tunix, a text-based search system inspired by Shazam, but designed to work without audio input. Instead, Tunix allows users to search for songs by typing lyrics, retrieving corresponding tracks, artists, and descriptive metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final system aims to provide efficient lyric-based search functionality, offering accurate results along with artist descriptions and related attributes, thereby improving music discovery through text queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Music retrieval systems such as Shazam have transformed how users interact with music, but they are primarily based on audio fingerprinting. In many cases, users may remember a fragment of lyrics rather than the melody. This project addresses this gap by creating Tunix, a system that retrieves songs, artists, and related information based on text queries derived from lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tunix will integrate datasets containing tracks, artists, lyrics, and metadata into a unified and searchable database. The system is designed to return not only the matching track but also relevant contextual information such as artist biography and related metadata. This project contributes to the field of Information Retrieval by developing a structured pipeline for music data collection and preparation, enabling efficient and accurate text-based search functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data search:\n",
    "- During our search for a suitable music dataset, we found many databases on this topic. However, most of them lacked song lyrics, while others included numerous attributes such as danceability and liveness, which were not relevant to our main objective. The biggest challenge we faced was related to artist information, as it was difficult to find datasets containing proper artist descriptions. To address this issue, we discovered that several APIs provide detailed information: given the name of a song, it is possible to retrieve the artist’s name, description, and additional attributes related to the song, the artist, and even the album.\n",

    "## Select convenient data subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Despite the availability of several good databases, we chose the Spotify Million Song Dataset. Although it contains fewer features, it is rich in music records and has fewer distinct artists, which reduces the number of required API calls. This way, we obtain fewer artists but more songs per artist. We also assumed that any additional attributes could later be retrieved through APIs to complement the dataset with artist information. \n",
    "- For this purpose, we selected the Genius API, as it focuses specifically on artists and music, providing detailed descriptions and additional metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assess the authority of the data source and data quality\n",
    "- Dataset: Spotify Million Song Dataset – Kaggle:\n",
    "    - Authority: Public dataset on Kaggle, licensed CC0 (free to use). It’s a subset of the original Million Song Dataset.\n",
    "    - Data Quality: Contains song names, artist names, lyrics, and links. Some entries may be missing or duplicate. \n",
    "- Genius API:\n",
    "    - Authority: Genius is a well-known platform for song lyrics and artist info. The API is official, documented, and widely used.\n",
    "    - Data Quality: Provides structured, regularly updated data. Some songs or artists may be missing, and user-contributed info can vary in quality.\n",

    "- **Null values**: Identify missing data in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Duplicate rows**: Detect repeated records that may need removal.\n",
    "- **Unique values per column**: Understand the variety of entries in each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Individual Checks\n",
    "- **Short string validations**:  \n",
    "  In long text fields like `artist_bio` and `lyrics`, we check for unusually short strings that may not make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wrong artist bios**:  \n",
    "  When fetching data from the Last.fm API, some entries may be invalid or return multiple results.  \n",
    "  To detect these cases, we focus on entries containing the strings:  \n",
    "  - `\"There are\"`  \n",

    "- `lastfm_artist_bio` → `artist_bio`  \n",
    "- `lastfm_release_date` → `release_date`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remove Columns\n",
    "Some columns are removed to reduce redundancy or low-information fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Songs:**\n",
    "- `link` → not interesting  \n",
    "- `lastfm_track_description` → low information  \n",

    "**Artist:**\n",
    "- `lastfm_artist_name` → same as `artist_name`  \n",

    "### Add Columns\n",
    "We add columns to improve dataset connectivity and identification:\n",

    "- `artist_id` → to connect with the Artist dataset  \n",

      "\"Moon River\" is a song composed by Johnny Mercer (lyrics) and Henry Mancini (music) in 1961, for whom it won that year's Academy Award for Best Original Song. It is most well-known for being sung in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's by Audrey Hepburn, although it has been covered by many other artists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt became the theme song for Andy Williams, who first recorded the song in 1961 and performed it at the Academy Awards ceremonies in 1962. He sang the first eight bars of the song at the beginning of his television show; he also named his production company and venue in Branson, Missouri after Moon River. Williams' version was vetoed by Cadence president Archie Bleyer, who believed it had little or no appeal to teenagers. Williams' famous version never charted, except as an LP track, which he recorded for Columbia in a hit album of 1962.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of the song was responsible for relaunching Mercer's career as a songwriter, which had stalled in the mid-1950s because rock and roll replaced jazz standards as the popular music of the time. An inlet near Savannah, Georgia, Johnny Mercer's hometown, was named Moon River in honor of him and this song. The popularity of the song is such that it has been used as a test sample in a study on people's memories of popular songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original version\\r\\nMercer and Mancini wrote the song for Audrey Hepburn to fit her vocal range. Initially the lyrics started, \"I'm Holly, like I want to be / like Holly on a tree back home...\", however they were later changed to fit the theme to the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough an instrumental version is played over the film's opening titles, the lyrics are first heard in a scene where Paul 'Fred' Varjak (George Peppard) discovers Holly Golightly (Hepburn) singing them, accompanied by her guitar, on the fire-escape outside their apartments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was much behind-the-scenes consternation which erupted when a Paramount Pictures executive suggested deleting the song from the film immediately after a very successful San Francisco preview. Hepburn's reaction has been described by Mancini and others in degrees varying from her saying \"over my dead body\" to her using somewhat more colorful language to make the same point.\\r\\n\\r\\nHepburn's version was not included in the original score album to Breakfast at Tiffany's. Instead, an album version recorded by Mancini and his chorus was released as a single and became a #11 hit. In different versions, Joel Whitburn's \"Top Adult (Contemporary) Songs\" reported the song as a #3 or #1 easy listening hit, due to unpublished charts in Billboard. Only months after Hepburn's death in 1993, her version was released on an album entitled Music from the Films of Audrey Hepburn.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther recordings\\r\\n\"Moon River\" was released by South African singer Danny Williams, and reached #1 in the UK. Shortly thereafter, Andy Williams recorded the song and made it his theme song. It was a hit for Jerry Butler in 1961, reaching #11 in the Billboard charts. Other artists that have covered the song are The Afghan Whigs, Benny Anderssons Orkester, Paul Anka, Blake, Louis Armstrong, Vince Guaraldi, Beru Revue, Mary Black, Sarah Brightman, Liz Callaway, Perry Como, Ray Conniff, Bobby Darin, Ania Dąbrowska, Dr. John, Dump, Billy Eckstine, The Four Freshmen, Connie Francis, Bill Frisell (instrumental), Emi Fujita, Judy Garland, Karel Gott, Grant Green (instrumental), Patty Griffin, The Innocence Mission (although this version is sometimes incorrectly cited as being performed by Milla Jovovich), Bradley Joseph (instrumental), Kim Yoo-jin, James Last, Joey McIntyre, Johnny Mathis, Brad Mehldau, Jane Monheit, Morrissey, Patsy Ann Noble, Jim Reeves, John Barrowman, R.E.M., Mia Riddle, Andrea Ross, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Sarah Vaughan, Nan Vernon, Kid Koala, Westlife, Victoria Williams, The Divine Comedy, and Tata Young.\\r\\n\\r\\nMercer himself recorded the song in 1974 for his album (appropriately named) My Huckleberry Friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n Read more on Last.fm.
